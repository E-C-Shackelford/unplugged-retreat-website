# unplugged-retreat-website
 A responsive website for Unplugged, a retreat designed for companies and professionals in the tech industry, encouraging individuals and teams to unplug from technology and the daily workplace routine in order to spend quality time in nature to reset and reconnect.
 
 With this project, I coded a responsive multipage website from a design comp for a fictional client, using a mobile-first design approach and implementing Flexbox, so that the site automatically adjusts its layout so that it can be easily and pleasantly viewed on different devices, whether that's on a mobile device, tablet, or desktop.
 In my process of creating this responsive multipage website, I first thought about who would use the site, how users would access the site, and what kind of features the content requires.
 In addition to its Homepage, this responsive multipage site features an About and FAQ page.
